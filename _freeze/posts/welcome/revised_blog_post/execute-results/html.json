However, this study examines whether young adults, specifically 19-year-olds, actually fare better in terms of employment in smaller towns compared to bigger cities. This blog post explores whether the size of a town impacts youth employment rates and how this understanding could reshape career planning for young adults.\n\n## Data Description\n\nThe dataset used in this analysis is sourced from the [TidyTuesdayR](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project. It includes employment data for 19-year-olds across different UK towns, categorized by size. The key variables include:\n\n- **Employment Rate**: The proportion of 19-year-olds employed with earnings above 0.\n- **Size Classification**: Categorizes the towns into \"Small\", \"Medium\", and \"Large\".\n  \n### Data Cleaning\n\nTo prepare the data for analysis, the following cleaning steps were performed:\n\n- Filtered out missing or non-numeric employment data.\n- Recoded the town size categories, excluding outliers like \"Inner London BUA\".\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\nThe data was analyzed using statistical techniques, including ANOVA and Tukey's HSD post-hoc test. The analysis revealed significant differences in employment rates across town sizes.\n\nThe box plot @fig-boxplot below shows the distribution of employment rates across different town sizes. Small towns tend to have a higher median employment rate for 19-year-olds, suggesting that starting one's career in a smaller town might offer better job opportunities.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The distribution of employment rates at age 19 across different town sizes.

In fact, smaller towns provide better employment opportunities for young people aged 19. This finding has important implications for both career planning and policy development. As urban areas face increasing competition and saturation, young adults may find more success by considering opportunities in smaller towns.\n\nONS. (2023).
