However, this analysis seeks to question that assumption by exploring whether 19-year-olds have better employment opportunities in smaller towns compared to bigger cities. Understanding this dynamic could offer valuable insights for young adults in the early stages of their career planning.\n\nThe data used in this analysis comes from the [TidyTuesdayR](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) project, sourced from [The UK office for National Statistics](https://www.ons.gov.uk/file?uri=/peoplepopulationandcommunity/educationandchildcare/datasets/educationalattainmentofyoungpeopleinenglishtownsdata/200708201819/youngpeoplesattainmentintownsreferencetable1.xlsx). It focuses on employment rates for 19-year-olds across different UK towns, categorized as:\n\n- **Employment Rate**: The percentage of 19-year-olds employed with earnings above zero.\n- **Size Classification**: Categorized into “Small,” “Medium,” and “Large” towns.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf <- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-01-23/english_education.csv')\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\nBefore conducting the analysis, the data went through a cleaning processes. Non-numeric employment data were removed, and town size categories were recoded, excluding outliers such as \"Inner London BUA\" to ensure consistent comparisons.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndf_clean <- df |>\n  clean_names() |>\n  filter(activity_at_age_19_employment_with_earnings_above_0 != \"*\") |>\n  mutate(Employment_Rate = as.numeric(activity_at_age_19_employment_with_earnings_above_0), \n         Size_Classification = as.factor(size_flag)) |>\n  filter(!Size_Classification %in% c(\"Inner London BUA\", \"Outer london BUA\", \"Not BUA\", \"Other Small BUAs\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe box plot below (@fig-boxplot) illustrates the distribution of employment rates across different town sizes. Small towns demonstrate a higher median employment rate for 19-year-olds compared to cities, which show both the lowest median and the largest variation in employment outcomes.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The distribution of employment rates at age 19 across different town sizes.

Small towns lead with an average employment rate of 50.1%, while cities fall behind with 42.6%.\n\n\n\n::: {#tbl-employment-rate .cell tbl-cap='The average employment rates for 19-year-olds across different town sizes.

Comparisons where the confidence intervals do not cross zero indicate statistically significant differences.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![The figure provides a quick visual overview of which pairwise comparisons are significant.](revised_blog_post_final_files/figure-html/fig-HSD-1.png){#fig-HSD width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThis analysis provides evidence that smaller towns offer better employment opportunities for young adults compared to larger cities and towns. With small and medium towns showing consistently higher employment rates, it challenges the conventional wisdom that large cities are always the best option for starting a career.\n\nThe findings suggest that young job seekers may find more opportunities in smaller towns, which could influence career planning strategies and policy decisions aimed at improving youth employment.\n\nONS.
