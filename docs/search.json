    "text": "The Green Divide: How wealth buys shade in a warming world\nThe article here is from Stuff news, titled “The Green Divide: How wealth buys shade in a warming world”, available online via Stuff news website.\nThis is a data journalism article, where a story created through examination of data to find trends and anomalies.\nThe article provides information about the uneven tree cover in New Zealand, oftentimes dictated by wealth. When the tree cover data and socio-economic data were visualised, affluent the area, the more tree canopy it owns. Furthermore, the article draws connection on how heritage contributes to green canopy and suburbs with lot of inaccessible greenery, such as hillside, might not provide shade to anyone.\nThe background for the article is in the first eight paragraphs. The article’s background provides context for knowing the importance of tree cover in urban areas, especially about the urban heat island effect. It describes how trees reduce temperature in cities by transpiring water. There is also emphasis on how the presence of more trees in more prosperous areas results in unequal heat exposure. This background is crucial because it highlights the article’s importance on the effects that the tree cover has on society and the environment.\nThe lede in the article is in the title, “How wealth buys shade in a warming world.” The author goes with two approaches of using the data to develop the content as well as backing up the story with the data. The article spans a narrative and takes the readers through a series of different case studies, explaining it clearly with annotated visualization.\nThe summary of the story is in the middle of the scrollable article:\n“When Stuff combined the council tree canopy maps with socio-economic data, it bore out the link between wealth and leafiness. The next map simultaneously shows the level of tree canopy cover in each neighbourhood in Auckland and how wealthy the area is: the darkest areas on the maps are the leafiest, most prosperous neighbourhoods. The lightest areas are those with little canopy cover and the lowest level of wealth.”\nThis conveys reader the fact that, areas with prosperity tend to be leafy, compared to the less prosperous area. For conciseness, some information has been omitted, as it is assumed that the reader is aware of the story’s bigger picture (cases of heritage and inaccessibility to greenery playing a role).\nAlthough, the result here is iterated throughout the article, that wealth and tree cover is related; by visualizing the data, article ends with the tone of irrelevancy and then concludes encouraging the city council to take steps.\nThe author quotes,\n“Canopy cover is measured because it’s really easy to measure but … all it gives you is a two-dimensional description. Any of that stuff around shading or transpirational cooling is related to leaf area — and canopy cover does not give you that.”\n“If [councils] know that there are neighbourhoods that only have four per cent canopy cover, they would hopefully see it as their responsibility to increase canopy cover in that area.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAstronomers use 400-year-old sketches to solve Sun’s longstanding mystery\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArun Krishnasamy\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPost With Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\ncode\n\n\nanalysis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 16, 2024\n\n\nHarlow Malloc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome To My Blog\n\n\n\n\n\n\nnews\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAug 13, 2024\n\n\nTristan O’Malley\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNo matching items"

    "text": "German astronomer Johannes Kepler made sketches of sunspots in 1607 from his observations of the sun’s surface - and centuries later, the pioneering drawings are helping scientists solve a solar mystery.\nEven though everything in the solar system revolves around the sun, scientists have yet to unlock many of the star’s secrets.\nSome of those questions revolve around solar activity in the 17th century, which was a pivotal time for studying the sun.\nAstronomers observed sunspots with telescopes for the first time in 1610.\nAt the same time, the sun was making an unusual transition into an extended period of weakened activity.\nHowever, studying the variability of the sun over time, including the solar cycle, could answer some of the most longstanding questions about the fiery orb and how it changes.\nAnd Kepler’s long disregarded sketches, overlooked because they were drawings rather than telescopic observations, could provide crucial historical insights.\nA new study that recreates the circumstances during which Kepler made his drawings appeared on July 25 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n“Kepler contributed many historical benchmarks in astronomy and physics in the 17th century, leaving his legacy even in the space age,” said lead study author Hisashi Hayakawa, assistant professor at Nagoya University’s Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, in a statement.\n“Here, we add to that by showing that Kepler’s sunspot records predate the existing telescopic sunspot records from 1610 by several years.\n“His sunspot sketches serve as a testament to his scientific acumen and perseverance in the face of technological constraints.”\n\nThe sun’s tumultuous activity\nThe sun experiences an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity, known as the solar cycle.\nCurrently, scientists believe that the sun is reaching or nearing solar maximum, the annual peak of its activity for the current solar cycle, called Solar Cycle 25.\nSolar maximum is typically associated with an increase in the number of sunspots visible on the sun’s surface."
