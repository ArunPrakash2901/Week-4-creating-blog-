    "text": "You might think that moving to a big city is the sure way to find a job, especially when you’re just starting out at 19. But what if I told you that small towns actually offer better job prospects for young adults? It’s true! Data shows that 19-year-olds living in smaller towns have higher employment rates than those in big cities. And the more we look into it, the more the data reveals that size does matter when it comes to landing that first job.\nThe study looked at employment rates across four types of towns—small, medium, large, and cities in UK. While cities are often seen as places full of opportunity, the numbers tell a different story. Small towns had the highest median employment rates, while cities, with all their hustle and bustle, had the lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The distribution of employment rates at age 19 across different town sizes. Cities have the lowest median and largest variation, while Small Towns have the highest variation but a median similar to Medium and Large Towns.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo make sure these differences weren’t just random flukes, we compared the employment data across the different town sizes. Imagine it like a reality show where each town size competes to prove it offers better job prospects, and this in statistics is known as ANOVA. And as we reviewed each contestant’s performance, the results Table 1 became crystal clear: small and medium towns consistently came out on top when it came to employment rates, leaving cities trailing behind.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: ANOVA Results for the Effect of Town Size Classification on Employment Rates at Age 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nSize_Classification\n3\n2066\n688.6\n15.7\n0\n\n\nResiduals\n1095\n48003\n43.8\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, you might wonder: how did we figure this out without just taking the numbers at face value? Think of it this way—when you’re comparing the job market in different places, there are a lot of factors that could skew the results. So, to be extra sure, we had to put the data through a “fairness filter”, and the filter I am referring to is the post-hoc Tukey HSD test. This filter looks at all the town sizes and checks whether the differences in job rates are big enough to be meaningful, or if they might just be due to random chance.\nAnd what did the filter show?Table 2\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Tukey HSD test results showing significant differences in employment rates between town sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\ncontrast\nestimate\nconf.low\nconf.high\nadj.p.value\n\n\n\n\nLarge Towns-City\n3.87\n-0.530\n8.28\n0.107\n\n\nMedium Towns-City\n6.14\n2.021\n10.27\n0.001\n\n\nSmall Towns-City\n7.52\n3.450\n11.59\n0.000\n\n\nMedium Towns-Large Towns\n2.27\n0.237\n4.31\n0.022\n\n\nSmall Towns-Large Towns\n3.65\n1.723\n5.57\n0.000\n\n\nSmall Towns-Medium Towns\n1.38\n0.228\n2.52\n0.011\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmall towns really do provide better chances for young adults to get a job.

While cities may have thousands of openings, they also have thousands of applicants. In smaller towns, job seekers are often competing with a much smaller pool of candidates, making it easier to land a job.\nAnother factor is networking. In small towns, personal connections can play a big role in getting your foot in the door. Knowing the local shop owner or a family friend who works at the factory might be just the edge you need. In big cities, where many people are outsiders, these networks don’t function as effectively.\nOne more factor could be the perception of the available jobs. Young adults in cities might feel overwhelmed or discouraged by the high competition, or they might not even be aware of entry-level positions that aren’t as visible among the numerous listings for more experienced candidates. In smaller towns, job openings might be fewer, but they’re often better suited for young people just starting out in their careers.\nInterestingly, this pattern holds even across medium and large towns, which also outperformed cities, though to a lesser extent than small towns.\nThis study challenges the long-held belief that moving to the city is the best path to career success. For many young adults, the reverse might be true. Cities may offer more options on paper, but small towns provide better chances of landing that first job. For policymakers, this suggests a need to focus on supporting young adults in cities, where high competition and saturation are real barriers.\nThis analysis was conducted using data from the TidyTuesdayR project, sourced from R for Data Science (2024). Employment rates for 19-year-olds were compared across different town sizes using statistical methods, confirming that smaller towns offer better employment prospects for young adults than big cities.\nData sources: R for Data Science (TidyTuesday dataset: Employment Rates), UK Government (Town size and demographic data), Census 2011 (Population and employment data).\nONS.

    "text": "German astronomer Johannes Kepler made sketches of sunspots in 1607 from his observations of the sun’s surface - and centuries later, the pioneering drawings are helping scientists solve a solar mystery.\nEven though everything in the solar system revolves around the sun, scientists have yet to unlock many of the star’s secrets.\nSome of those questions revolve around solar activity in the 17th century, which was a pivotal time for studying the sun.\nAstronomers observed sunspots with telescopes for the first time in 1610.\nAt the same time, the sun was making an unusual transition into an extended period of weakened activity.\nHowever, studying the variability of the sun over time, including the solar cycle, could answer some of the most longstanding questions about the fiery orb and how it changes.\nAnd Kepler’s long disregarded sketches, overlooked because they were drawings rather than telescopic observations, could provide crucial historical insights.\nA new study that recreates the circumstances during which Kepler made his drawings appeared on July 25 in The Astrophysical Journal Letters.\n“Kepler contributed many historical benchmarks in astronomy and physics in the 17th century, leaving his legacy even in the space age,” said lead study author Hisashi Hayakawa, assistant professor at Nagoya University’s Institute for Space-Earth Environmental Research, in a statement.\n“Here, we add to that by showing that Kepler’s sunspot records predate the existing telescopic sunspot records from 1610 by several years.\n“His sunspot sketches serve as a testament to his scientific acumen and perseverance in the face of technological constraints.”\n\nThe sun’s tumultuous activity\nThe sun experiences an 11-year cycle of waxing and waning activity, known as the solar cycle.\nCurrently, scientists believe that the sun is reaching or nearing solar maximum, the annual peak of its activity for the current solar cycle, called Solar Cycle 25.\nSolar maximum is typically associated with an increase in the number of sunspots visible on the sun’s surface."

    "text": "The common perception that moving to a large city automatically leads to better job opportunities has been widely accepted for years. However, this analysis seeks to question that assumption by exploring whether 19-year-olds have better employment opportunities in smaller towns compared to bigger cities. Understanding this dynamic could offer valuable insights for young adults in the early stages of their career planning.\nThe data used in this analysis comes from the TidyTuesdayR project, sourced from The UK office for National Statistics. It focuses on employment rates for 19-year-olds across different UK towns, categorized as:\n\nEmployment Rate: The percentage of 19-year-olds employed with earnings above zero.\nSize Classification: Categorized into “Small,” “Medium,” and “Large” towns.\n\n\ndf &lt;- readr::read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2024/2024-01-23/english_education.csv')\n\nBefore conducting the analysis, the data went through a cleaning processes. Non-numeric employment data were removed, and town size categories were recoded, excluding outliers such as “Inner London BUA” to ensure consistent comparisons.\n\ndf_clean &lt;- df |&gt;\n  clean_names() |&gt;\n  filter(activity_at_age_19_employment_with_earnings_above_0 != \"*\") |&gt;\n  mutate(Employment_Rate = as.numeric(activity_at_age_19_employment_with_earnings_above_0), \n         Size_Classification = as.factor(size_flag)) |&gt;\n  filter(!Size_Classification %in% c(\"Inner London BUA\", \"Outer london BUA\", \"Not BUA\", \"Other Small BUAs\"))\n\nThe box plot below (Figure 1) illustrates the distribution of employment rates across different town sizes. Small towns demonstrate a higher median employment rate for 19-year-olds compared to cities, which show both the lowest median and the largest variation in employment outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: The distribution of employment rates at age 19 across different town sizes. Cities have the lowest median and largest variation, while Small Towns have the highest variation but a median similar to Medium and Large Towns.\n\n\n\n\n\nTo quantify the employment opportunities in each town size, the table below (Table 1) summarizes the average employment rates for each category. Small towns lead with an average employment rate of 50.1%, while cities fall behind with 42.6%.\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: The average employment rates for 19-year-olds across different town sizes. Small towns exhibit the highest average employment rates, while cities show the lowest.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSize_Classification\nAverage_Employment_Rate\n\n\n\n\nCity\n42.6\n\n\nLarge Towns\n46.5\n\n\nMedium Towns\n48.7\n\n\nSmall Towns\n50.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo confirm whether these differences in employment rates across town sizes are statistically significant, an ANOVA test was conducted. The results below (Table 2) indicate that there is a statistically significant difference between the town size categories.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: ANOVA Results for the Effect of Town Size Classification on Employment Rates at Age 19\n\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\ndf\nsumsq\nmeansq\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\nSize_Classification\n3\n2066\n688.6\n15.7\n0\n\n\nResiduals\n1095\n48003\n43.8\nNA\nNA\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile ANOVA identifies that differences exist between town sizes, it does not specify which pairs of town sizes differ significantly. The Tukey HSD post-hoc test (see table Table 3) addresses this by providing pairwise comparisons between town sizes.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Tukey HSD Post-hoc Test results showing pairwise comparisons between town sizes.

Comparisons where the confidence intervals do not cross zero indicate statistically significant differences.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The figure provides a quick visual overview of which pairwise comparisons are significant.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis analysis provides evidence that smaller towns offer better employment opportunities for young adults compared to larger cities and towns. With small and medium towns showing consistently higher employment rates, it challenges the conventional wisdom that large cities are always the best option for starting a career.\nThe findings suggest that young job seekers may find more opportunities in smaller towns, which could influence career planning strategies and policy decisions aimed at improving youth employment.\nONS.
