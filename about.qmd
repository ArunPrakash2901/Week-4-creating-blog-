I am currently pursuing a Master of Business Analytics at Monash University, where I am exploring the exciting intersection of data, technology, and business. While I am still discovering my specific interests within the field, I am passionate about learning and developing my skills in data analysis, machine learning, and business problem-solving.

As I continue to grow in my studies, I am eager to take on new challenges and collaborate on projects that leverage data to drive insights and impact. I believe in the power of data to shape better decisions and improve outcomes across industries.

This website is a space where I will share some of my projects and learning experiences as I progress in my journey towards becoming a skilled business analyst. If you would like to connect or discuss a project, feel free to reach out to me through the contact information below.
